# Racing-game-using-pygame-lib
This is a project that uses Python and Pygame to create a video game. Pygame is a powerful and flexible library that provides access to graphics, sound, input, and other features that are essential for game development. In this project, I will show you how to use Pygame to create a simple platformer game with a character, enemies, obstacles, and collectibles.

Requirements:
To run this project, you will need:
-Python 3.8 or higher
-Pygame 2.5.2 or higher
You can install Python from the official website and Pygame from PyPI using the following command:

>>pip install pygame

How to run
To run the game, simply execute the main.py file in your terminal:
>>python main.py

You can use the arrow keys to move the character and the spacebar to jump. Avoid the barricade and enjoy the game as it's difficulty increases periodically. The game ends when you hit a obstacle......enjoy :) 

Benefits of using Pygame
-Pygame is a great library for game development, as it offers many benefits, such as:
-Cross-platform compatibility: Pygame works on Windows, Linux, MacOS, and other platforms that support Python and SDL.
-Simplicity and flexibility: Pygame has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to use and learn. It also gives you full control over the game loop and the game logic, allowing you to create any kind of game you want.
-Performance and efficiency: Pygame is fast and lightweight, as it uses SDL, which is a low-level library that interacts directly with the hardware. Pygame also supports hardware acceleration, which improves the rendering speed and quality of the graphics.
-Community and documentation: Pygame has a large and active community of developers and users, who provide support, feedback, and resources. Pygame also has a comprehensive and well-written documentation, which includes tutorials, examples, and reference guides.
